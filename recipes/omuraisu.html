            <h2>Omuraisu (Japanese Rice Omelet)</h2>
            <p>Omuraisu is similar in flavor and style to hash browns and eggs. This delicious Japanese dish works wonderfully as a breakfast, lunch, or dinner, especially for those not ready for the traditional raw fish or white rice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="list-div">
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cooked white or brown rice</li>
            <li>2 thin slices cooked ham, cubed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>1 slice processed cheese food (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div class="list-div">
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Add cooked rice, 2 tablespoons ketchup, ham, and cheese, if using. Cook and stir until ingredients are well combined and heated through, about 8 minutes. Scoop mixture onto a serving bowl and shape into an oval.</li>

            <li>In a bowl, beat eggs and salt and pepper. Heat a small skillet coated with cooking spray over medium heat. Add egg mixture; cook over medium heat. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath. Use a spatula to gently fold eggs into a cocoon shape. When eggs are completely set, remove from the heat.</li>

            <li>Place omelet on top of rice and run a knife length-wise through the top layer of omelet. It should open like a butterfly and drape over rice. Top with final tablespoon of ketchup and a sprinkle of parsley.</li>
        </ol>
