<h2>Onigiri (Japanese Rice Balls)</h2>
<p>This easy onigiri recipe is also fun to make! These rice balls are a staple of Japanese lunchboxes (bento). You can put almost anything in these rice balls; try substituting grilled salmon, pickled plums, beef, pork, turkey, or tuna with mayonnaise.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
    <li>5 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups water, divided</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)</li>
    <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-inch strips</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. Combine washed rice and 4 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rice rest for 15 minutes to continue to steam and become tender. Allow cooked rice to cool.</li>
    <li>Combine remaining 1 cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen hands before handling rice. Divide cooked rice into 8 equal portions. Use one portion of rice for each onigiri.</li>
    <li>Divide one portion of rice in two. Create a dimple in rice and fill with a heaping teaspoon of bonito flakes. Cover with remaining portion of rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball. Gently press rice to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining portions of rice.</li>
